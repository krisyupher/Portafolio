Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my strong interest in the Backend Developer position at your organization. As a results-driven Full-Stack Software Developer with 4+ years of professional experience and proven expertise in designing and deploying scalable, secure backend systems, I am confident in my ability to architect solutions that power your applications and drive innovation. My backend development expertise has been honed through challenging, high-impact projects for government agencies and enterprise clients. At Corte Suprema de Justicia de Colombia (Colombia's Supreme Court), I architected mission-critical backend systems serving millions of citizens, designing a judicial decision search system that reduced query time from minutes to milliseconds while managing 500,000+ records. I contributed to the ESAV system that digitalized 80% of judicial processes, reducing case processing from 4 months to 10 days. At SETI S.A.S, I developed secure backend infrastructure for Davivienda's real estate platform serving one of Colombia's largest financial institutions, ensuring compliance with strict banking regulations.

My technical expertise encompasses modern backend development: advanced Node.js/Express.js and .NET, expert REST API design with GraphQL intermediate proficiency, advanced PostgreSQL and MongoDB with schema design and optimization, proven security and compliance expertise meeting banking and government regulations, Redis for high-performance caching, strict TypeScript implementation, SOAP and REST service integration, Docker containerization and Azure cloud deployment, and advanced Jest testing with comprehensive coverage. Having worked with government agencies and financial institutions, I understand the critical importance of security, compliance, and reliability. As someone whose first language is Spanish now established in English-speaking professional environments in Toronto, I bring strong communication and cultural awareness to cross-functional teams. I am genuinely excited about contributing my architectural expertise to your organization and am confident my technical skills and proven ability to deliver enterprise-grade solutions make me an outstanding candidate.

**Sincerely,**

Cristian Florez
